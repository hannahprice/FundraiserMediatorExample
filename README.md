# FundraiserMediatorExample

A basic console app to demonstrate the Mediator pattern, without the MediatR library.

The `CharityPot` acts as the mediator between the `Fundraiser` and the charity they are donating to.

- Charity pot created with a fundraising goal.
- Fundraisers created and registered with charity.
- Fundraisers donate to charity pot.
- Fundraisers receive updates for every donation made, including the running total and their personal total.
